# Installation Guide

## Step One: Install Tampermonkey
https://www.tampermonkey.net/

## Step Two: Install Skirk Marble
[Skrik Marble](https://github.com/Seris0/Wplace-SkirkMarble) is a fork of [Blue Marble](https://bluemarble.lol/) with extra features, including multi template support.

Click here to download the script https://github.com/Seris0/Wplace-SkirkMarble/releases/download/latest/SkirkMarble.user.js

## Step Three: Download json templates
[AFIP-ALL](https://github.com/AmericanFlagInWPlace/AFIP-SkirkMarble-Templates/blob/main/AFIP-ALL.json) contains all of our current templates. Or, you can download each individually via their separate files.

## Step Four: Install the templates
Navigate to https://wplace.live. At the bottom of the Skirk Marble window, click the "Import Templates" button.

Note: Importing always creates new templates, and will not override previous verseions. You may want to go through and delete your old ones when updating to a new version.
