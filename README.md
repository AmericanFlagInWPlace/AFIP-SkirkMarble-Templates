# Template Installation Guide

## Step One: Install Tampermonkey
https://www.tampermonkey.net/

## Step Two: Install Skirk Marble
[Skrik Marble](https://github.com/Seris0/Wplace-SkirkMarble) is a fork of [Blue Marble](https://bluemarble.lol/) with extra features, including multi template support.

Click here to download the script https://github.com/Seris0/Wplace-SkirkMarble/releases/download/latest/SkirkMarble.user.js

## Step Three: Download json templates
[ALL.json](https://github.com/AmericanFlagInWPlace/AFIP-SkirkMarble-Templates/blob/main/output/templates/ALL.json) contains all of our current templates.

Or, you can download each template individually via their separate files in the [templates](https://github.com/AmericanFlagInWPlace/AFIP-SkirkMarble-Templates/blob/main/output/templates) folder.


## Step Four: Install the templates
Navigate to https://wplace.live. At the bottom of the Skirk Marble window, click the "Import Templates" button.

Note: Importing always creates new templates, and will not overwrite previous versions. You may want to delete your old templates before importing to prevent duplicates.

# Image Converter Usage

## Step One: Run image_converter.exe once to generate the input folder.

## Step Two: Place PNGs in the folder 'input/pngs' folder and run the exe again.
Make sure files are named in the following format `name-tileX-tileY-pixelX-pixelY.png` e.g. `Kansas-452-776-75-731.png`.

## Step Three: Processed templates and PNGs will be in the 'output' folder, ready to add to Skirk Marble
